# Archeological-Eurasian

This is my master thesis repository. 

I studied a paper named Triangulation supports agricultural spread of the transeurasian languages that proposes a full description of cultural expansion in Eastern-Asia from 15 000 BP to 2500 BP.

You will find here a full study of the methods used in the paper and an answer to its conclusions.
